# Hi — I'm Potatoery

I make things.  
I enjoy building apps, tools, and experiments with a focus on clarity and practical value.

---

## About
- Role: Maker  
- Focus: clarity, simplicity, and practical outcomes  
- Philosophy: do fewer things, do them well — document and test what matters

---

## What I make
- Apps and tools with attention to usability and maintainability  
- Libraries and developer tooling with clear APIs  
- Experiments that combine practicality and curiosity (including AI integrations)

---

## Selected projects

- [Nemois-git/Revis](https://github.com/Nemois-git/Revis) — Reservation & site customization (private, Swift)  
- [Nemois-git/Taskis](https://github.com/Nemois-git/Taskis) — Task/productivity app with widget support (private, Swift)  
- [Nemois-git/Bandis](https://github.com/Nemois-git/Bandis) — Band community app (private, Swift)

AI-driven projects
- [Nemois-git/Prometheus](https://github.com/Nemois-git/Prometheus) — Prometheus: The AI, Built by AI. (public, Swift + Metal)  
  Why it matters: design and documentation were produced with strong AI assistance; focuses on AI-driven features and developer tooling.  
  Included: detailed docs (README, API_DOCUMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, FILE_DOCUMENTATION.md). Public (MIT). Languages: Swift (~95.5%), Metal (~4.5%). Start with README → API docs.

- [Nemois-git/nemoDatabase](https://github.com/Nemois-git/nemoDatabase) — [WIP] nemoisDatabase (public, Swift)  
  Why it matters: Swift-first persistence library intended for experimentation and clear APIs. See `Package.swift`, `Sources/`, and the README for usage and examples.

---

## How to explore
- Read each repo's top-level README first.  
- For AI work, start with architecture or API docs (Prometheus) or `Package.swift` (nemoDatabase).  
- Typical local steps (if you have access):
  - git clone <repo-url>
  - Open the workspace in Xcode (if present)
  - Read Docs/ and README before running

---

## Skills & tools
- Strengths: prototyping, practical problem solving, clear APIs, documentation  
- Familiar with: Swift (used in several projects), Git, Swift Package Manager  
- Practices: iteration, testing where it helps, documentation-first when useful

---

## How I work
- Start with readable code — optimize only when necessary  
- Prefer short examples and tests over long explanations  
- Communicate trade-offs and progress clearly when collaborating
