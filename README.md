# Hi, I'm Jeongcheol Kim 👋

Founder of **nemois** | Server-side Swift Developer

---

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I’m Jeongcheol Kim, founder and one-man team behind **nemois**. My journey is a little different—I hold a bachelor’s degree in Information, Telecommunication, and Electronic Engineering, not software engineering. But my passion for building inclusive technology drives me every day.

## ✨ About nemois
**nemois** is my personal mission to create applications that everyone can use—especially those often overlooked, like elderly people. I believe technology should be approachable and empowering for all.

## 🚀 Projects

### [Revis](https://github.com/Nemois-git/Revis)
A customizable reservation management application. Revis enables users to handle reservations and site personalization, focusing on flexibility and user-driven features.

**Tech highlight:**
_Revis and Revis_Backis utilize asynchronous delta synchronization, ensuring only changes are exchanged for faster, more efficient real-time updates between frontend and backend._

### [Revis_Backis](https://github.com/Nemois-git/Revis_Backis)
Backend server for Revis, built using Swift and the Vapor framework. Handles server-side logic and data management for reservation operations, forming the foundation for the Revis system.

### [Revis_Frontis](https://github.com/Nemois-git/Revis_Frontis)
Frontend for Revis, built using TypeScript. Provides the user interface and client-side interactions for the Revis reservation manager, connecting seamlessly with the backend.

### [nemois_Siteis](https://github.com/Nemois-git/nemois_Siteis)
The official site for nemois. Acts as the central hub for information about the nemois company and its projects.

## 🛠️ Main Skills
- **Swift** (Server-side, Vapor framework)
- Learning and building for the people—not just the tech!

## 👀 Fun Fact
I didn’t major in software engineering, but I love learning and making tech that truly matters.
